#  Credit Eligibility Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine learning system
for **credit eligibility prediction**, developed as part of a Machine Learning
class project. The project follows a complete **CRISP-DM workflow**, from data
preprocessing and model training to evaluation and deployment via an
interactive Streamlit dashboard.

##  Project Overview

Manual credit approval processes are often slow, inconsistent, and prone to
bias. This project aims to **automate credit eligibility decisions** using
supervised machine learning models trained on real-world banking data.

The final system:
- predicts whether a client is eligible for credit,
- provides probability-based decisions,
- is deployed as an **interactive web dashboard** using Streamlit.

##  Machine Learning Task

- **Task type:** Supervised learning  
- **Problem:** Binary classification  
- **Target variable:** `credit_obtenu`  
  - `0` → Credit not obtained  
  - `1` → Credit obtained
